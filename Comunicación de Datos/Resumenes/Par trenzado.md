**Twisted pair** is described in the sources as the **least expensive and most widely used guided transmission medium**. It consists of **two insulated copper wires arranged in a regular spiral pattern**. A wire pair acts as a **single communication link**, and typically, a number of these pairs are bundled together into a cable by wrapping them in a tough protective sheath. Over longer distances, cables may contain hundreds of pairs. The **twisting tends to decrease the crosstalk interference between adjacent pairs in a cable**, and neighboring pairs in a bundle often have somewhat different twist lengths to further reduce this interference. On long-distance links, the twist length typically varies from 5 to 15 cm, and the wires in a pair have thicknesses of from 0.4 to 0.9 mm.

Twisted pair is the most common medium for both **analog and digital signals** and is the workhorse for communications within buildings and the telephone network. In the telephone system, individual residential telephone sets are connected to the local telephone exchange, or “end office,” by **twisted-pair wire, referred to as subscriber loops**. Within office buildings, each telephone is also connected to a twisted pair that goes to the in-house private branch exchange (PBX) system or to a Centrex facility. These installations were initially designed for analog voice traffic, but with a **modem**, they can handle digital data traffic at modest data rates. Twisted pair is also commonly used for digital signaling, with data rates of **64 kbps being common for connections to a digital data switch or digital PBX within a building**. It is also frequently used within buildings for **local area networks (LANs) supporting personal computers**, typically at data rates around **100 Mbps**, although networks with rates up to **10 Gbps have been developed for limited scopes**. For long-distance applications, twisted pair can be used at data rates of **4 Mbps or more**.

Compared to coaxial cable and optical fiber, twisted pair is **much less expensive and easier to work with**. It can transmit both analog and digital transmissions. For analog signals, amplifiers are needed about every 5 to 6 km, and for digital transmission, repeaters are required every 2 or 3 km. However, twisted pair is **limited in distance, bandwidth, and data rate**. Its attenuation is a very strong function of frequency, and it is quite **susceptible to interference and noise** due to its easy coupling with electromagnetic fields, such as 60-Hz energy from AC power lines and impulse noise. Several measures are taken to reduce these impairments, including shielding the wire and twisting the wire with varying twist lengths.

There are two main varieties of twisted pair: **unshielded twisted pair (UTP)** and **shielded twisted pair (STP)**. **UTP is ordinary telephone wire** and is commonly prewired in office buildings, making it the **least expensive of all transmission media used for LANs** and easy to work with and install. However, UTP is subject to external electromagnetic interference. **STP** improves upon UTP by including a **metallic braid or sheathing that reduces interference**, providing better performance at higher data rates, but it is more expensive and difficult to work with.

Most office buildings are prewired with **voice-grade (100-ohm) UTP**. Standards like **EIA-568** (1991) and **EIA-568-A** (1995) specify the use of both UTP and STP for in-building data applications, addressing the need for higher data rates (up to 100 Mbps) for LANs. A key difference between **Category 3 and Category 5 UTP** is the number of twists, with Category 5 being much more tightly twisted (0.6 to 0.85 cm twist length vs. 7.5 to 10 cm for Category 3), resulting in better performance but higher cost. **Table 4.2** compares the attenuation and near-end crosstalk (coupling of signal from one pair to another at the same end) for these types. Newer categories like **Enhanced Category 5 (Cat 5E), Category 6, and Category 7** have been developed for even higher performance LANs, as summarized in **Tables 4.3 and 4.4**.

In the context of LANs, twisted pair was used in early **bus topologies** (voice-grade, 1 Mbps) but is not practical for higher data rates in this configuration. It is commonly used in **star topologies** with hubs, where each station connects via two UTP lines (transmit and receive), typically limited to 100 meters. **10BASE-T Ethernet** also uses UTP in a star topology with a 100-meter link limit. **Fast Ethernet (100BASE-T)** specifications include options like **100BASE-TX** (2 pair STP or Cat 5 UTP, 100 Mbps, 100m) and **100BASE-T4** (4 pair Cat 3/4/5 UTP, 100 Mbps, 100m). Twisted pair is also a transmission medium option for **IEEE 802.5 token ring LANs** at various speeds.

The **wires are twisted in twisted-pair copper wire to decrease crosstalk interference** between adjacent pairs. Major limitations of twisted-pair wire include its **limited distance, bandwidth, and data rate** compared to other guided media and its **susceptibility to interference and noise**. The key difference between **unshielded twisted pair (UTP) and shielded twisted pair (STP)** is that STP has a **metallic shield** to reduce electromagnetic interference, offering better performance at higher data rates at the cost of increased expense and difficulty in handling.
